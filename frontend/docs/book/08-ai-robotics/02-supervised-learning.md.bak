## 06-Project 5: Simple Visual Object Tracking Robot

This project introduces basic computer vision into a mobile robot. You will build a robot that uses a camera to detect a colored object (e.g., a red ball) and then autonomously move towards and track that object. This project integrates perception, decision-making, and motor control based on visual input.

### 6.1 Objective

Build a mobile robot (preferably using an ESP32-CAM or Raspberry Pi for camera processing) that detects a specific colored object (e.g., a red ball) and tracks its movement by driving towards it and keeping it centered in its field of view.

### 6.2 Key Concepts Covered

*   **Electronics:** Mobile robot platform, motors, motor drivers, ESP32-CAM/Raspberry Pi.
*   **Programming:** Python (for Raspberry Pi/MicroPython on ESP32) or C++ (for more advanced ESP32-CAM/ESP-IDF setups), image processing (color thresholding), basic object detection, motor control.
*   **Computer Vision:** Color space conversion (HSV), thresholding, morphological operations, contour detection, centroid calculation.
*   **Actuators:** DC motor control based on visual feedback.
*   **Algorithms:** Simple visual servoing (proportional control based on object position).

### 6.3 Materials Required

#### 6.3.1 Hardware Components

*   **ESP32-CAM (or Raspberry Pi Zero W / Raspberry Pi 3/4):** 1 (This will be the brain for image processing)
    *   **ESP32-CAM:** More compact, lower power. Requires external motor driver.
    *   **Raspberry Pi:** More powerful, easier to work with Python/OpenCV. Can often directly drive motor drivers.
*   **Robot Chassis:** A small mobile robot chassis with two DC gear motors and wheels.
*   **DC Gear Motors:** 2
*   **Wheels:** 2
*   **Caster Wheel/Skid:** 1
*   **L298N Motor Driver Module (or equivalent for ESP32/Pi):** 1
    *   **Note:** For Raspberry Pi, dedicated HATs with motor drivers are available and simplify wiring.
*   **Battery Pack/Holder (6-12V):** 1 (for motor driver power)
*   **USB Power Bank (for ESP32-CAM/Raspberry Pi):** Crucial for powering the camera board independently.
*   **Jumper Wires:** For connecting components on a breadboard.
    $N_1 = (N \cdot \text{\{sum_xy\}}) - (\text{\{sum_x\}} \cdot \text{\{sum_y\}})$
    $D_1 = (N \cdot \text{\{sum_x_sq\}}) - (\text{\{sum_x\}})^2$
    $m = N_1 / D_1$

    And for the intercept $b$:
    $$ b = \frac{\{\text{\{sum_y\}} - m \cdot \text{\{sum_x\}}\}}{\{N\}} $$

    Where:
    *   $N$ is the number of data points.
    *   $\text{\{{\{sum_x\}}\}}$ is the sum of all $x$ values.
    *   $\text{\{{\{sum_y\}}\}}$ is the sum of all $y$ values.
    *   $\text{\{{\{sum_xy\}}\}}$ is the sum of products of $x_i y_i$.
    *   $\text{\{{\{sum_x_sq\}}\}}$ is the sum of squares of $x_i$.

### Practice Tasks

1.  **Robot Terrain Classification:** You are building a mobile robot that needs to classify the terrain it's on (e.g., "smooth," "rough," "water"). It has a sensor that provides two features: (vibration magnitude, wheel slip). You have collected labeled data. Describe how you would use a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier to train the robot for this task.
2.  **Predicting Robot Power Consumption:** A robot needs to estimate its power consumption (in Watts, a continuous value) based on its current speed (m/s) and payload (kg). You have collected data. Which supervised learning algorithm would be most appropriate for this task, and why?
3.  **Decision Tree for Fault Diagnosis:** Design a simple decision tree (conceptually, draw it out) for a robot's fault diagnosis. The robot has two sensors (Temperature, Current) and needs to diagnose "Normal," "Overheat," or "Overcurrent." For example, if Temp > X and Current < Y -> Overheat.

### Notes for Teachers

*   **Illustrate Labeled Data:** Emphasize the importance of labeled data for supervised learning, contrasting it with human learning.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Discuss how selecting good features (e.g., from sensor data) is critical for model performance.
*   **Overfitting Intuition:** Explain overfitting with a simple analogy (e.g., memorizing answers instead of understanding the concept).

### Notes for Students

*   **Data is Key:** The quality and quantity of your labeled training data directly impact the performance of your supervised learning models.
*   **No Free Lunch:** No single algorithm is best for all problems. The choice depends on your data and the task.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Understand accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification) and MSE, RMSE (for regression) to evaluate your models.
*   **Preprocessing Matters:** Scaling features (e.g., using `StandardScaler` in Python) is often essential for many ML algorithms.
